 * I'm gonna be honest here, until now i did not know about memmove and memcpy
 * I used IA to review some of my code and it showed me this way of working with
 * generic types, so now on i will start using more of this functions. I promise
 * nothing here is copy pasted from IA, i only used it to explain concepts and revise 
 * major errors.
